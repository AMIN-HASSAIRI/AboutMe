abstract: The aim of this present work is to develop an iterative method called Gauss Newton Method to resolve inverse problems. The inverse problem is formulated as an optimization problem in the sense of least squares. In order to minimize the computation time related to resolving this inverse problem, a method with direction of descent (method of Gauss Newton) is chosen. This algorithm allows a good compromise between accuracy and computation time. Directional methods descent that may present numerical instabilities, the Gauss Newton algorithm is stabilized in order to be able to identify the model parameters considered.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The goal of this work is to develop an iterative method, specifically the Gauss-Newton Method, to solve inverse problems. These problems are formulated as optimization tasks using least squares. To reduce computation time, the Gauss-Newton Method is selected for its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency. While directional descent methods can sometimes cause numerical instabilities, the Gauss-Newton algorithm is stabilized to ensure it can reliably identify the model parameters.
