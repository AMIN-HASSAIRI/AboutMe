abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition has shown a significant upward trend in recent years. This paper investigates an ASR system for the Arabic language developed using the Conformer-CTC characterbased model within the NeMo framework. The system leverages the latest deep learning techniques, focusing
on the conformer architecture combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification for sequence-to-sequence learning. The model is supervised, using
labeled training data to map the input audio to text. The Mozilla Common Voice 11.0 dataset, which offers diverse spoken Arabic samples, is used for training.
This paper details the model training process, including configuration setup, data processing, and optimization strategies. The performance of the model is evaluated, offering insights into the challenges and effectiveness of the Conformer-CTC character-based model for Arabic speech recognition tasks.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper explores the development of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for the Arabic language using a Conformer-CTC character-based model within the NeMo framework. The system employs advanced deep learning techniques, combining the Conformer architecture with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for sequence-to-sequence learning. Supervised training is performed with labeled data to map audio input to text. The Mozilla Common Voice 11.0 dataset, containing diverse Arabic speech samples, is used for training. The paper discusses the model training process, including configuration, data processing, and optimization strategies, and evaluates the model's performance, highlighting both challenges and successes in applying the Conformer-CTC model to Arabic speech recognition.
